# application setup block
app_setup_block_enabled: true
app_setup_block: |
  This application is dependent on an SQL database be it one you already have or a new one. If you do not already have one, set up our MariaDB container.

  Once the MariaDB container is deployed, you can enter the following commands into the shell of the MariaDB container to create the user, password and database that the app will then use. Replace myuser/mypassword with your own data.

  **Note** this will allow any user with these credentials to connect to the server, it is not limited to localhost

  ```
  from shell on sql container:
  mysql -u root -p
  CREATE DATABASE monica;
  GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
  GRANT ALL privileges ON `monica`.* TO 'myuser'@'%';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```

  Once you have completed these, you can then use the docker run command to create your MonicaHQ container. Make sure you replace things such as <yourdbuser> with the correct data.

  Then docker start monica to start the container. You should then be able to access the container at http://dockerhost:6875

  If you intend to use this application behind a reverse proxy, such as our LetsEncrypt container or Traefik you will need to make sure that the `APP_URL` environment variable is set, or it will not work
